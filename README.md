# Personal Website

This repository is for my personal portfolio website and holds an ASP.NET project.
Currently, my existing personal website is only holding static html files and styles. But I'd like to change this into a dynamic one using the ASP.NET Core 4.7 framework.

The current existing site is holding as a static website on Azure Storage. This project will now be updated to use Azure Web/App services and hosted there.

You can view my existing personal website at [johnny-le.me](https://johnny-le.azureedge.net/).
