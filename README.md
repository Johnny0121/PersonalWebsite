# Personal Website

This repository is for my personal portfolio website and holds an ASP.NET project.
Currently, my existing personal website is only holding static html files and styles. But I'd like to change this into a dynamic one using the ASP.NET Core 4.7 framework.

You can view my existing personal website at [johnny-le.me](johnny-le.me).
